See the INSTALL file for build instructions.

This is the WCS Gateway Module to be loaded by the OPeNDAP Back-End Server
(BES).  For more information on Hyrax and the BES, please visit our
documentation wiki at docs.opendap.org. This will include the latest install
and build instructions, the latest configuration inforamtion, tutorials, how
to develop new modules for the BES, and more.

C++ source and header files - WCS Gateway Module code

* About the WCS Gateway Module

The WCS Gateway Module adds functionality to the OPeNDAP Back-End Server
(BES) allowing it to retrieve data served by WCS requests. This is a gateway
service and does not provide WCS functionality, simply returns OPeNDAP
responses for WCS requests served by a remote WCS server.

* Configuration

Once the WCS Gateway Module has been installed, you will need to add the
module to the local BES configuration file. This configuration file is
located in the BES installation directory under etc/bes and is called
bes.conf. You will also need at least the netcdf module and hdf4 module from
OPeNDAP. Download these two modules and follow the instructions for
configuring the BES to load these modules.

To load the WCS Module into the BES you will need to add wcs to the list of
modules. Locate the paramter called BES.modules and add ",wcsg" to the end
of that line. For example:

<code>
    BES.modules=dap,cmds,ascii,usage,www,nc,h4,wcsg
</code>

Next you will need to tell the BES where to find the WCS Gateway Module. Add
thefollowing line after BES.modules:

<code>
    BES.module.wcsg=/path/to/libwcs_gateway_module.so
</code>

There is one WCS Gateway specific parameter that needs to be set in the BES
configuraiton file. At the bottom of this file is a place where you can
specify module-specific parameters. Add the following:

<code>
    WCS.TypeList=netcdf:nc;hdf:h4;
</code>

The WCS.TypeList paramter tells the WCS module how to translate WCS
datatypes into BES data types. You shouldn't have to change this value.

* Testing

For testing, please refer to the INSTALL file. An internet connection is
required for these tests to run successfully.
