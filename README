Updated for version 1.1.0 of the OPeNDAP BES - WCS Gateway Module

See the INSTALL file for build and installation instructions.

This is the WCS Gateway Module to be loaded by the OPeNDAP Back-End Server
(BES).  For more information on Hyrax and the BES, please visit our
documentation wiki at docs.opendap.org. This will include the latest install
and build instructions, the latest configuration inforamtion, tutorials, how
to develop new modules for the BES, and more.

* What's here:

C++ source and header files - WCS Gateway Module code
unit-tests/ - directory containing unit tests. See below for testing.

* About the WCS Gateway Module

The WCS Gateway Module adds functionality to the OPeNDAP Back-End Server
(BES) allowing it to retrieve data served by WCS requests. This is a gateway
service and does not provide WCS functionality; itreturns OPeNDAP
responses for data served by a remote WCS server.

* Configuration

Once the WCS Gateway Module has been installed, you will need to check
the configuration of the module. In the $prefix/etc/bes/modules
directory there will be a wcsg.conf file. This file is the configuraiton
file for the wcs gateway module that gets loaded by the BES.

There is one WCS Gateway specific parameter that needs to be set in the BES
configuraiton file. At the bottom of this file is a place where you can
specify module-specific parameters. You should see the following:

<code>
    WCS.TypeList=netcdf:nc;hdf:h4;
</code>

The WCS.TypeList paramter tells the WCS module how to translate WCS
datatypes into BES data types. You shouldn't have to change this value.

* Testing

For testing, please refer to the INSTALL file. An internet connection is
required for these tests to run successfully.
